Pure C solution for LeetCode
============================

This project aims at solving [LeetCode algorithm problems] with pure C Language 
using as little library functions as I can, which means except memory management
functions and few string functions I will implement everything I need such
as trees, stacks, queues and hash tables.

Parts of the problems don't provide C interface for solution, so I accomplished
them with C++ Language.

Compile **C** files using command:

    gcc -std=c99 -Wall src/foo.c -o foo

Compile **C++** files using command:

    g++ -std=c++11 -Wall src/bar.cpp -o bar

**OR**

You can build all the files using `make` (Use MinGW GCC and GNU Make on Windows).

The `☢` means that you need to have a LeetCode Premium Subscription.
